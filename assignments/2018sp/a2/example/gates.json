So please take a second and just listen (listen)
Up in your speakers I’m wishin to write a weaker precondition
Took a few small steps, I was feeling like a dope
Now I’m up in OCaml, we using lexical scope

But once again I need to try to understand this,
All these pedantic antics tripping up my semantics
I can stress, how much I really want to do it all
But once it’s said I can’t take it back it’s immutable

And there was only one course plan
Turning twenty-one, going on 3110
But really, at this moment, I’m still living in terror
Because the type checker be giving me compile time errors

The C A M L, with an O at the front
It’s not imperative scaring ya, and we ain’t tryna stunt
Just tryna process every single type to keep it in check
And having higher-order fun with it is just a side effect

OCaml is a very sexy European car. It's not quite as fast as C, but it 
never breaks down, so you end up going further in less time. However, 
because it's French, none of the controls are in the usual places.

\"...A category whose objects are the object of C and whose morphisms from C1
to C2 are the C-morphisms from C1 to M(C2). Given f : C1 → C2 and g : C2 → C3
in Eff(M), their composition in Eff(M) is the C-morphism f ; M(g) ; µ_C3.\"

They sure teach some advanced material in 1110 these days.

You recall that 3110 office hours are being held in Rhodes 405. Hey, at least
you don't have to walk to Surge Academic Building A in the Ag Quad. 

Once you're done reviewing 1110 material, exit SOUTH back to the corridor."

confident walking into Prof. Clarkson's office than you did before.

\"Hey,\" Prof. Clarkson greets you warmly. \"Did you have another question?\"

\"No, I think you've answered all my questions,\" you initially respond. Then,
you add, \"Oh, actually, what should I do with this lambda?\"

Prof. Clarkson thinks for a moment.

\"Unfortunately, that's not a question that I can answer for you. What you do
with the lambda is up to you.\"

\"So...I can use Obj.magic?\"

\"That's not what I meant. At the end of this semester, your time with 3110
will end. Maybe you'll come back as a consultant or TA. Maybe you'll never
program in a functional language ever again. But I hope that your newfound
knowledge of the lambda and what you've learned in this class--the functional
programming paradigm, the principles of software engineering, and so forth--
will serve you well in the future.\"

\"Well, thank you. I'll try not to let you down.\"

Before you leave, Prof. Clarkson calls out to you. \"Actually, can I ask you
for a favor? There's a man I know named Dennis. Could you show him that lambda
you have?\"

Head WEST when you're ready to exit the office."

After what seems to be an eternity of silence, you home in on the perfect
question: \"Why do you love functional programming?\"

Prof. Clarkson smiles, takes a deep breath, and starts: \"That's a great
question! To answer that, we'll have to go all the way back to the beginning.
In the 1930's, Alonzo Church formulated what we now know as untyped lambda
calculus...\"

As you absorb all this information, you feel as if spacetime is distorting

concern in his eyes. Looks like you fell asleep somehow. \"Sorry,\" you yawn in

lot out of you guys.\"

little bit brighter. \"You've given me a lot of ideas to think about,\" you tell

  "win_message": "After a long day wandering around Gates Hall, you reflect on everything you've
seen and experienced, both today and throughout the semester so far. You've
learned a lot about functional programming--why it's important and why it's
elegant. Many of the professors on campus who have taught 3110 in the past are
active researchers in the field of programming languages, and functional
programming is one of the foundations of that field. As you'll soon learn,
functional programming also has deep ties to logic and mathematics.

As your mind wanders, lost in thought, you suddenly remember something.

\"Wait, wasn't I working on A2? The deadline is Wednesday, October 4--will I
finish in time?\"

You start to curse yourself for waiting an entire day walking around Gates
instead of working on A2. Then, you realize:

\"Hold on, if I've gotten this far in the this adventure, that means I've
completed the game engine! ...So I'm done with A2, right?\"

...

\"...Uh, of course, I've been writing black-box unit tests in my test suite
while I was coding the engine, and I've made sure to write good specifications
and follow code style conventions, too.\"

Good! But what else?

\"I suppose there's still the overview document and my own adventure file...
Let's see, maybe an adventure about Gates Hall could be kinda funny...\""
