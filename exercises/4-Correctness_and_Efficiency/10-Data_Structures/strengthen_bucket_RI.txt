insert: expected O(1)
  When no rehash is required, takes O(c) where c is the number of elements
  in a bucket, worse than original.
  When rehash is required, worse case O(n), worse than original.
find: expected O(1), better then original
remove: expected O(1).
  When no rehash is required, a little better than original.
  When a rehash is required, worst case O(n), but every insert takes O(c) 
  where c is number of elements in a bucket, worse than original.
